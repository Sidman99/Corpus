# Corpus
In my corpus (as of now) I would like to explore a certain evolution of the same genre. In this case: Punk and Post Punk. Even though they both have the same predecessors they are different styles of music. A lot of people argue that punk is dead and this is also one of the reasons the genre Post Punk came into being. There is a clear division between the two. From the mid 70s and 80s and onwards post punk evolved. In the 1990s bands like Green Day were leading artists in the field. I would like to explore the similarities and differences between the listeners of Punk and Post Punk. Do the listeners of Post Punk also listen to Punk and vice versa? Are there similarities in other genres these people listen to? Are there clear and obvious differences? In this I would also like to explore the demographics of them both. I presume that the audience that listens to Punk and are a bit older (50-60+) do not listen as much to Post Punk as the younger Post Punk audience actually listens to Punk. I hope I find a surprising common genre both groups of audiences listen to, if I am lucky I might even find the reason/historical event that caused it.  
Oh is dat zo?
